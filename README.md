# mexico-bird-app
A model and simple app that takes images of birds (specfically trained for birds in Mexico w/ spanish names) and predicts the species with the possibility %.

Training data was parsed from publically available images and labels on naturalista.mx. The images were then sorted and filtered in a way to maximize training efficiency while also allowing for the widest range of species to be learned by the model.
